This can be helpful both as exploratory data analysis, since anyone can download EF files whenever they'd like, as well as more robust analysis, as Gensim is a powerful topic modeling/machine learning library. This notebook will introduce a few new functions to reformat EF files to a format that can be fed directly into a topic modeling library, such as Gensim or MALLET, as well as some very entry-level visualization of our generated topics using [pyLDAvis](https://github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis)."

The number of topics is custom for each set of volumes/documents and is often something that you should test out. Do your results make more or less sense with more or fewer topics? The number of passes will effect the \"accuracy\" of your topic models. The algorithm is training the topics as many times as you input passes, and then taking an aggregated average of the results. Since there is a random element to topic modeling, results are different for every pass. The more passes we do, the more we can reduce the randomness of the results. Here, we're doing 50 passes, since our data is not too big, but you may find more or less is suitable based on testing out results. Another way to minimize the randomness is to set the seed, or in Gensim the `random_state`. By setting the \"seed\" or the `random_state` we are saying to eliminate the randomness and always go with the number option we indicate. You can play with this number as well and see how the results change. We have started with 42 because it is the answer to eveything.\n",
